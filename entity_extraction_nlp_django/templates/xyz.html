If you’re upgrading to a new major version, make sure you have the latest compatible trained pipelines installed, and that there are no old and incompatible packages left over in your environment, as this can often lead to unexpected results and errors. If you’ve trained your own models, keep in mind that your train and runtime inputs must match. This means you’ll have to retrain your pipelines with the new version.</div> </figure> </body> </html>
